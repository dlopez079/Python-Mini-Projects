# Project Title

I created this repository so I can practice basic fundamentals of the Python3 language. Below you will see a list of beginners projects that I will work on to get familiar and comfortable with the language. 

## Getting Started

### Quiz Game

I created the Quiz game and had my son take the quiz.  The quiz will have 5 questions in which the user will answer.  Everytime a user gets the correct answer, I will provide an output and increment their score.  At the end of the quiz, I will total up their score and provide them a percentage of correct answers.
