# Project Title

I created this repository so I can practice basic fundamentals of the Python3 language. Below you will see a list of beginners projects that I will work on to get familiar and comfortable with the language. 

## Getting Started

### Quiz Game

I created the Quiz game and had my son take the quiz.  The quiz will have 5 questions in which the user will answer.  Everytime a user gets the correct answer, I will provide an output and increment their score.  At the end of the quiz, I will total up their score and provide them a percentage of correct answers. 

### Number Guess

I created a game where the user will choose a number representing the top of the range.  The starting point will be zero.  Using a 'Math Random Method,' the computer will select a random number, and the user will then try to guess this number.  I will track the number of times the user guesses for the number.  I will let the user know when he assumes the correct number and give him hints when he chooses the wrong number.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

User will input either Rock, Paper, Scissors where the computer will beat you.  At the end of the game, I will count the total number of wins by a user and the total number of wins by computer.
